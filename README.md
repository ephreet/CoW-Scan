**🐄 CoW-Scan – Console Web Scanner Tool**

CoW-Scan (Console Web Scanner) is a lightweight web scanning tool designed to run directly from the browser's console. 

It is still pretty green and under *REALLY* lazy development, I started fiddling with it to have an aid in discovering hidden paths, mining parameters, and analyzing web responses with ease — when other *REAL* tools aren't available or not an option.



**🚀 Features**

✅ Path Discovery – Discover hidden paths using a customizable wordlist.

✅ Parameter Mining – Find GET parameters and analyze responses for differences.

✅ Depth Control – Customize crawl depth to fine-tune your scans.

✅ Custom Paths – Add custom paths for targeted discovery.

✅ Limit Scans – Set maximum items to try from the discovery and parameter lists.

✅ Stop on First Match – Option to stop scanning once a valid path or parameter is found.

✅ Resume from Last Match – Resume scans from where you left off.



**🛠️ How to Use**

Open your browser's developer console (F12 or Ctrl + Shift + I).

Copy and paste the CoW-Scan script into the console.

Follow the on-screen menu to start scanning!


**🌐 Why CoW-Scan?**

Simple and fast — no installation required.

Directly leverages browser-based network capabilities.

Ideal for quick recon and web penetration testing.
